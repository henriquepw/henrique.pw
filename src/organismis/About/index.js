        My name is Henrique, you must have seen my name on the main screen,
        I&apos;m from a little town that nobody knows called Montadas, from the
        countryside of Para√≠ba in Brazil and since I was a little techie, I
        started programming when I entered high school , with my 14 years old
        not knowing where I was getting in, but I ended up liking it and here I
        am writing this.
